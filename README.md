This project is a web page about upload grade to websit. I used 'sessionStorage' to store the data instead of using a database. <br/>

Four main features in this web. First, add a course by enter the course name, course number, course grade item adn geade percentage. After, add a course, a course list in the home page. Cick the course link, it will show a student list under this course. At the begining, there should be no student there. So, add a student by entering the student name, student ID and student email address. After adding a student, a new student list will shows under this course. Cilking the student link, a grade information page shows. It is a table includes 
grade item and grade percentage. There is 'null' grade at first, so click update grade button, a input textbox shows and enter grade there. Click save button, the new grade has updated. For the last function, after adding all information, click send grade button, it will send detail grade information to student email.
